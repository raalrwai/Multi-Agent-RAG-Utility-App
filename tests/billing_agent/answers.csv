Thomas Garcia,How can I reduce my electricity bill?,"Based on Thomas Garcia's recent electricity bill, here are some tailored suggestions to help reduce future electricity bills:  ### Bill Overview - Most recent usage: 1260 kWh for the last billing period (25 days) - Total charges: $284.30 - Average daily cost: $6.55 - Main charges: Supply ($57.01), Delivery ($85.03), Customer charge ($13.49), Taxes ($12.07)  ### Ways to Reduce Your Electricity Bill  1. **Lower Usage:**    - 1260 kWh in 25 days is higher than average (over 40 kWh per day). Try to identify high-usage appliances and reduce their use.    - Turn off lights and electronics when not in use.    - Use energy-efficient bulbs (LEDs).  2. **Appliance Efficiency:**    - Upgrade to ENERGY STAR-rated appliances—they use less electricity.    - Unplug chargers and electronics when not in use, as many draw power even when off.  3. **Heating and Cooling:**    - With average temperatures at 58 °F, heating could be a factor. Lower your thermostat in winter and dress warmly instead.    - Use ceiling fans for better air circulation and reduce the reliance on HVAC.    - Seal windows and doors to prevent heat loss.  4. **Laundry and Kitchen:**    - Wash clothes in cold water and avoid small loads.    - Air-dry clothes when possible.    - Run dishwashers and washing machines only when full.  5. **Check Your Bill for Errors:**    - Confirm your meter readings and billing period match your actual usage periods.    - Contact your utility for a home energy audit—they may offer one for free or at a discount.  6. **Review Your Rate Plan:**    - Ask AEP Ohio if they have time-of-use or off-peak rate plans and try to shift high-energy activities to off-peak times.  7. **Consider Home Improvements:**    - Add insulation to attic/walls if your home loses heat quickly.    - Install programmable thermostats.    - Replace old windows with energy-efficient ones.  If you want step-by-step help with reviewing which appliances or usage patterns are the biggest energy draws, let me know! I can provide more personalized tips if you share information about your household size and daily routine."
