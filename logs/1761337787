[explanation]  Hi Linda Wilson,

I don’t have an electricity bill on file for you yet. If you upload a copy or a clear image of your electricity bill, I’ll be able to give you a detailed explanation of:

- Your total charges and how they’re calculated
- The breakdown of your energy usage (in kWh) and rates
- Any extra fees, taxes, or credits that appear on your bill
- How your bill compares to previous months (if those details are available)

Once you upload the bill, I’ll guide you through each part and help answer any questions about your usage or charges.
