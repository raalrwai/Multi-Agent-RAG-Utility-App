Once you upload or share your bill details, I can help you fully understand every part of it!

[explanation]  Hi Linda,

Your electricity bill this month is $114.73. This amount covers all the costs related to your electricity usage for the most recent billing period. The bill is due on or before March 11, 2022, so you’ll need to pay this amount by that date to avoid any late fees.

If you want more details about how this amount was calculated or a breakdown of specific charges, just let me know! I can help you understand any section of your bill.
